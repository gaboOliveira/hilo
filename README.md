# hilo

This project is coded in two parts

backend & frontend

The backend part is done by using a simple layered infrastructure and uses Microsoft Orleans as a framework to host player actors in memory which the main goal is to have in the server a reference of the real user along with your data. [Microsoft Orleans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/).
It has just 3 endpoints which will git the frontend the ability to register (just the user name is required at this moment), start a game and send an attempt.

The fronend part is done by using react and serves a page (the screeshots bellow)
